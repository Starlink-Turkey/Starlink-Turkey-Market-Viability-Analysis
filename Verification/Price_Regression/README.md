# Price Regression Analysis - Verification

## Overview

This verification suite validates the price regression analysis for predicting optimal Starlink pricing in Turkey. The analysis uses economic indicators from 76 countries to predict appropriate pricing strategies.

## Files

- `validation_tests.py` - Comprehensive test suite for price regression model
- `validation_report.md` - Detailed findings and business recommendations
- `../../requirements.txt` - Dependencies for running the validation tests (root level)

## Key Findings

### Price Prediction
- **Turkey Price**: $56.11 USD (2.4% below global average)
- **Confidence Interval**: $51.42 - $61.23 (95% confidence)
- **Global Average**: $57.50 USD

### Model Performance
- **R² Score**: 0.185 (limited explanatory power)
- **Cross-validation RMSE**: ±$13.08
- **Statistical Significance**: No individual predictors significant (p > 0.05)

### Critical Issues
- **Multicollinearity**: GDP and Internet Usage correlation r = 0.931
- **Non-normal residuals**: Indicates missing variables
- **Limited predictive power**: Only 18.5% of variance explained

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run validation tests:
   ```bash
   python validation_tests.py
   ```

3. Review detailed analysis in `validation_report.md`

## Business Impact

### Pricing Strategy
- Use $56.11 as baseline price for Turkey
- Consider pricing flexibility within $51-$61 range
- Position slightly below global average for competitive advantage

### Risk Factors
- Model limitations require supplemental market research
- High uncertainty suggests conservative pricing approach
- Consider regional economic variations within Turkey

## Recommendations

1. **Strategic Planning**: Use prediction as starting point for pricing strategy
2. **Market Research**: Supplement with local market analysis
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Monitor pricing from existing providers
4. **Flexibility**: Maintain ability to adjust pricing based on market response

## Status

✅ **VALIDATED** - Model suitable for strategic planning with acknowledged limitations
