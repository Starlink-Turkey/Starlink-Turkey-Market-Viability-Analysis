# Starlink Price Regression Model - Validation Report

## Executive Summary

The Starlink price regression model predicts a **$56.11 USD** monthly price for Turkey, which is **2.4% below the global average** of $57.50. However, the model has several limitations that should be considered when using this prediction for strategic planning.

## Model Performance Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- **Reasonable prediction accuracy**: ¬±$13.08 RMSE on average
- **Statistically significant overall**: F-test p-value = 0.002
- **Realistic Turkey prediction**: Within 95% confidence interval of $51.42 - $61.23
- **Good data quality**: 76 countries with complete data, no missing values

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations  
- **Low explanatory power**: R¬≤ = 0.185 (only 18.5% of price variation explained)
- **Weak individual predictors**: No single variable is statistically significant (all p > 0.05)
- **High multicollinearity**: GDP and Internet Usage are highly correlated (r = 0.931)
- **Non-normal residuals**: Shapiro-Wilk test shows non-normal distribution

## Data Quality Analysis

### Dataset Overview
- **76 countries** with Starlink availability
- **Complete data** for all key variables
- **Wide economic range**: GDP from $1,678 to $139,466
- **Diverse markets**: Internet usage from 19.8% to 99.3%

### Outlier Detection
- **GDP outliers**: Ireland ($124,901), Luxembourg ($139,466)  
- **Internet usage outliers**: 12 developing countries below 50%
- **Price outliers**: 11 countries with unusual pricing (US $120, Nigeria $37)
- **Broadband price outliers**: 4 countries with extreme costs ($457+ in Solomon Islands)

### Data Validation Results
‚úÖ **No extreme values** outside reasonable business ranges  
‚úÖ **Consistent data types** and proper preprocessing  
‚úÖ **Logical relationships** between variables

## Model Assumptions Testing

### 1. Linearity: ‚úÖ SATISFIED
- Correlation between actual and predicted: 0.400 (reasonable)
- Log transformation improved linear relationships

### 2. Normality: ‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATED
- Shapiro-Wilk test: p < 0.001 (non-normal residuals)
- May indicate missing variables or non-linear relationships

### 3. Homoscedasticity: ‚úÖ SATISFIED
- Variance ratio test: F = 1.319 (< 3.0 threshold)
- Consistent error variance across prediction range

### 4. Independence: ‚úÖ ASSUMED
- Cross-sectional data (countries) assumed independent
- No temporal autocorrelation concerns

### 5. Multicollinearity: ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE DETECTED
- **High correlation** between GDP and Internet Usage (r = 0.931)
- May inflate standard errors and reduce coefficient significance

## Turkey-Specific Validation

### Economic Context
- **GDP PPP**: $42,326 (middle-high income)
- **Broadband Price**: $11.00 (affordable)
- **Internet Usage**: 86% (high penetration)

### Prediction Analysis
- **Predicted Price**: $56.11 USD
- **Confidence Interval**: $51.42 - $61.23 (95%)
- **Relative to Global Average**: -2.4% (slightly below average)

### Comparable Countries
Similar economic indicators suggest Turkey pricing should be in the **$45-$67 range**:
- **Bulgaria**: $55 (similar GDP)
- **Croatia**: $57 (similar GDP)
- **Romania**: $52 (similar broadband price)
- **Poland**: $57 (similar overall profile)

### Sensitivity Analysis Results
- **GDP sensitivity**: LOW (¬±20% GDP ‚Üí ¬±$0.25 price change)
- **Broadband price sensitivity**: MODERATE (¬±50% BB price ‚Üí ¬±$1.32 price change)
- **Internet usage sensitivity**: HIGH (¬±10% usage ‚Üí ¬±$1.65 price change)

## Statistical Significance Analysis

### Overall Model
- **F-statistic**: 5.439 (p = 0.002) ‚úÖ Significant
- **Adjusted R¬≤**: 0.151 (moderate explanatory power)

### Individual Coefficients
- **GDP**: Œ≤ = 0.024 (p = 0.682) ‚ùå Not significant
- **Broadband Price**: Œ≤ = 0.034 (p = 0.290) ‚ùå Not significant  
- **Internet Usage**: Œ≤ = 0.322 (p = 0.268) ‚ùå Not significant

**Interpretation**: While the model as a whole is statistically significant, none of the individual predictors are significant, suggesting:
1. Variables may be correlated (multicollinearity)
2. Missing important predictors
3. Non-linear relationships not captured

## Cross-Validation Results

### Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
- **Mean R¬≤**: Not available (numerical issues)
- **Prediction Error**: ¬±44.9% typical range
- **MAE**: $8.40 (reasonable for pricing decisions)
- **RMSE**: $13.08 (acceptable for strategic planning)

## Business Recommendations

### 1. Pricing Strategy
- **Target Price**: $56.11 (model prediction)
- **Pricing Range**: $51-$61 (confidence interval)
- **Market Positioning**: Slightly below global average (competitive)

### 2. Model Limitations
- **Use as starting point only** - not final pricing decision
- **Consider local factors** not captured in model:
  - Regulatory environment
  - Competition from local ISPs
  - Currency fluctuations
  - Consumer purchasing power

### 3. Additional Data Needs
To improve model accuracy, consider adding:
- **Regulatory factors**: Licensing costs, spectrum fees
- **Competition metrics**: Number of ISPs, market concentration
- **Economic indicators**: Inflation, currency stability
- **Geographic factors**: Population density, terrain difficulty

### 4. Risk Assessment
- **High uncertainty**: ¬±44.9% prediction error
- **Model limitations**: Low R¬≤ suggests missing variables
- **Recommendation**: Use $56.11 as baseline, adjust based on local market research

## Conclusion

The regression model provides a **reasonable starting point** for Turkey pricing at **$56.11 USD**, positioning Starlink competitively in the Turkish market. However, the model's limited explanatory power (R¬≤ = 0.185) and lack of individually significant predictors suggest that **additional factors** should be considered for final pricing decisions.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. ‚úÖ **Prediction is reasonable** and within expected range
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Model has limitations** - use with caution
3. üìä **Sensitivity analysis** shows Internet Usage is most important factor
4. üîç **Additional research** needed for final pricing strategy

**Recommendation**: Use $56.11 as baseline price, conduct additional market research to validate and refine based on local conditions.
